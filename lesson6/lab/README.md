## Lesson 06 - Lab Session


### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*	Practice web development by transforming a design comp into an HTML and CSS web page.


This is an ambitious project to build! We're wrapping up the HTML/CSS focused portion of our course before we head into some JavaScript work next week. We're hoping to give you another chance to practice building a webpage from scratch before we add interactive elements. The goal here is to divide and conquer. Look at the provided png file, determine the sections that are needed, and then code.
