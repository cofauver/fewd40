#Organize your files (due 2/11) 

I reviewed a required file organization system for your homework submission during the lesson tonight. Please organize your files and GitHub repos to match this system of organization. It will streamline grading and allow us to create a live version of all of your pages in class on Thursday.

#Final Project Step 1 (due 2/18)


This is an open ended project where you create a webpage of your own. The first step is to refine your concept for what your project will be and create a wireframe of the page. You can create a wireframe on paper or on a tool like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) or [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com/). Simple is fine. We want you to get started thinking about what your final project will be and what it will look like.
