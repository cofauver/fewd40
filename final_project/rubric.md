#FEWD Final Project

---


###Description


For the final project, you'll be designing and building a website of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio.  You could create: a portfolio website; a marketing website for a startup or business; or a prototype for a simple web-app. Work with your instructor and EIR's to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.
